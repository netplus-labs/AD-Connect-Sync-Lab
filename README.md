# AD-Connect-Sync-Lab

# üîÑ Azure AD Connect Sync Lab

This lab was designed to simulate a **Hybrid Identity environment** by syncing on-prem Active Directory users and passwords to Azure AD using **Azure AD Connect**.

Although full synchronization didn‚Äôt complete due to domain verification issues, this lab demonstrates critical setup steps and helps identify where cloud readiness and DNS configuration come into play.

## üí° Lab Objectives

- Simulate a hybrid setup using VirtualBox
- Sync on-prem users and passwords to Azure AD
- Match UPN suffixes for seamless authentication
- Understand DNS, Password Hash Sync, and Writeback options
- Learn from failed sync due to missing custom domain verification

| Step | Description | Screenshot |
|------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | Setup custom DNS (DC IP + 8.8.8.8) for domain join and internet | ![DNS Setup](./screenshots/1.png) |
| 2 | Join the server to the local domain | ![Join Domain](./screenshots/2.png) |
| 3 | Modify user UPN to match Azure domain | ![UPN Match](./screenshots/3.png) |
| 4 | Install and configure Azure AD Connect | ![AD Connect Setup](./screenshots/4.png) |
| 5 | Enabled Password Hash Synchronization | ![Hash Sync](./screenshots/5.png) |
| 6 | Enabled Password Writeback | ![Writeback](./screenshots/6.png) |

## üöß Challenges Faced

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Sync didn‚Äôt complete due to missing **custom domain verification** in Azure AD.
- A public/rented domain is required for seamless federation and synchronization.

---

## ‚úÖ Key Learnings

- AD Connect is a powerful tool to bridge identity between on-prem and cloud.
- Proper DNS and UPN alignment is critical for successful sync.
- Even failed attempts offer valuable insights into how hybrid identity works.

---

## üìå Next Steps

I will explore domain verification with a public DNS zone and retry the sync in the future. Stay tuned for updates!

## üß† Author Note

This lab taught me that understanding identity sync involves **more than just installation‚Äîit‚Äôs architecture, DNS, and policy alignment**. I‚Äôll continue to solidify this skill as I advance toward enterprise-ready hybrid cloud scenarios.
